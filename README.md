**Web Scraping and NLP Pipeline**

**Overview:**
This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to web scraping and building NLP (Natural Language Processing) pipelines using Python. Through a series of guided exercises, learners gain hands-on experience with web scraping techniques, text preprocessing, and NLP tasks such as named entity recognition (NER).

**Key Objectives:**
- **Web Scraping**: Learn how to extract data from web sources using libraries like Scrapy and BeautifulSoup. Understand the process of making HTTP requests, parsing HTML content, and extracting structured data from web pages.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Explore various text preprocessing techniques including cleaning, tokenization, stop words removal, stemming, and lemmatization. Understand the importance of preparing text data for NLP tasks.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Gain familiarity with NER, a fundamental NLP task involving identifying and classifying named entities in text. Explore both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches for NER.

**Contents:**
- **Scraping**: Code snippets and examples demonstrating web scraping techniques using Scrapy and BeautifulSoup.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Code examples showcasing various text preprocessing techniques in Python using libraries like NLTK and spaCy.
- **NER**: Examples illustrating named entity recognition using both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of key learnings and takeaways from the project.

**Conclusion:**
This project provides learners with a solid foundation in web scraping and NLP techniques. By following the guided exercises and exploring the provided code examples, learners gain practical skills that can be applied to real-world projects involving data extraction, text analysis, and natural language understanding. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with web scraping or an NLP enthusiast seeking to enhance your skills, this project offers valuable insights and resources to help you succeed.
